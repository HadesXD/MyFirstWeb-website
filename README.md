# My First Website
In 2017, I first started learning about web development. <br/>
I had to create a website for project weekends for students, that teachers could add and students could join. <br/>
I learned a lot, however this repository is more of a look at how much of a rookie I am. <br/>
I am now trying to make a better website: https://github.com/SloDS/FilmDen-website

<b>Using:</b>
- languages: HTML5, CSS3, PHP, SQL (MySQL)
- IDE: NetBeans 8.2
- Programs: Toad Data Modeler, XAMPP
